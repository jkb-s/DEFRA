![Top](ScreenShots/sigma.png "Graph from DEFRA")

## 1. Name
The name DEFRA is a simple shorthand for DEfense FRAmework, thus should be pronouced *dÄ“-fra*. 

## 2. Directory structure:
```
- DSystems
    - AV.json
    - EDR.json
    - MDE.json
- DTechniques
    - AV
        - Mimikatz-has-been-blocked.json
    - MDE
        - An-anomalous-scheduled-task-was-created.json
- Mitigations
    - Induction-training-for-new-employees.json
- attack.py
- defend.py
- attack.json
- config.json
```

- attack.py - parsing and indexing MITRE ATT&CK data
- defend.py - parsing defense techniques metadata and generating reports
- attack.json - MITRE ATT&CK data
- config.json - all configuration required by attack and defend objects
- Mitigations - all mitigations that are used by the organization, should be represented under this directory.
- DSystems - here defense systems metadata should be placed
- DTechniques - defense techniques, each in separate json file, should be under this directory. They can be additionally divided into subdirectories. 

## 3. Defense Technique file structure

## 3. Initialization

```python
from attack import Attack
from defend import DTechnique, DSystem, Defend

de = Defend(Attack(local=True))
```
Code above parses all MITRE ATT&CK data (attack.json) and all json files under DSystems and DTechniques directories (as specified in config.json).
After that, everything is under Defend object. 

### ATT&CK namespace

- de.attack.cfg - config.json parsed to SimpleNamespace object
- de.attack.techniques - dictionary, ID as key
- de.attack.data_sources - dictionary, ID as key
- de.attack.data_components - list of objects (lack of ID from ATT&CK)
- de.attack.groups - dictionary, ID as key
- de.attack.mitigations - dictionary, ID as key
- de.attack.software - dictionary, ID as key
- de.attack.relations - list

Following classes are used to hold ATT&CK data:
```
ATechnique
ARelation
AGroup
ASoftware
ADatasource
ADatacomponent
AMitigation
```

Example code how to access techniques data:

```python
T1027 = de.attack.techniques['T1027']
T1027.name
> 'Obfuscated Files or Information'
```

There are multiple handy indices that are calulated during the initialization:
- de.attack.data_components_by_technique 
    ```python
    de.attack.data_components_by_technique['T1027.011']
    > {
        'WMI: WMI Creation',
        'Windows Registry: Windows Registry Key Creation'
    }
    ```
- de.attack.groups_by_technique
    ```python
    de.attack.groups_by_technique['T1021.005']
    > {'G0036', 'G0046', 'G0047', 'G0117'}
    ```
- de.attack.mitigations_by_technique
    ```python
    de.attack.mitigations_by_technique['T1021.005']
    > {'M1033', 'M1037', 'M1042', 'M1047'}
    ```
- de.attack.soft_by_technique
- de.attack.techniques_by_data_component
- de.attack.techniques_by_group
- de.attack.techniques_by_mitigation
- de.attack.techniques_by_soft

    ```python
    print(de.attack.software['S0061'].name)
    for tech in de.attack.techniques_by_soft['S0061']:
        print("{:10} {}".format(tech, de.attack.techniques[tech].name))
    
    > HDoor
    > T1562.001  Disable or Modify Tools
    > T1046      Network Service Discovery
    ```

### Defend namespace


- de.attack - ATT&CK object
- de.techniques - Defense Techniques parsed from json files
- de.systems - Defense Systems parsed from json files

Classes used to hold defense data:
```
DTechnique
DSystem
```

Example code to access defense technique and show which ATT&CK Techniques it can detect, plus what accuracy did you specify for it:
```python
de.techniques['D.MDI.2036'].name
> Remote code execution attempt over DNS

for tech in de.techniques['D.MDI.2036'].detects:
    accuracy = de.techniques['D.MDI.2036'].detects[tech]['accuracy']
    tname = de.attack.techniques[tech].name
    print("{:10} Accuracy: {:10} {}".format(tech, accuracy, tname))

> T1210      Accuracy: medium     Exploitation of Remote Services
> T1068      Accuracy: medium     Exploitation for Privilege Escalation
```

Additional indices:

- de.techniques_per_attack_techniques
- de.techniques_per_datasource
- de.techniques_per_system
- de.techniques_per_severity
- de.techniques_per_scope



    ```json
    de.techniques_per_scope
    > {
        "countries": {
            "Germany": [
                "D.AV.1", "D.EDR.1"
            ],
            "Turkey": [
                "D.AV.1"
            ]
        },
        "clients": {
            "Client-E": [
                "D.AV.1", "D.EDR.2", "D.ELSTC.1"
            ]
        },
        "systems": {
            "windows": [
                "D.AV.1", "D.CHKPNT.1"
            ],
            "linux": [
                "D.CHKPNT.1", "D.EDR.1"
            ]
        } 
    }
    ```
