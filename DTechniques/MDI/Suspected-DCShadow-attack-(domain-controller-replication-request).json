    "description": "Active Directory replication is the process by which changes that are made on one domain controller are synchronized with other domain controllers. Given necessary permissions, attackers can grant rights for their machine account, allowing them to impersonate a domain controller. Attackers strive to initiate a malicious replication request, allowing them to change Active Directory objects on a genuine domain controller, which can give the attackers persistence in the domain. In this detection, an alert is triggered when a suspicious replication request is generated against a genuine domain controller protected by Defender for Identity. The behavior is indicative of techniques used in domain controller shadow attacks.",
