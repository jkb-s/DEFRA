    "description": "A domain controller shadow (DCShadow) attack is an attack designed to change directory objects using malicious replication. This attack can be performed from any machine by creating a rogue domain controller using a replication process. In a DCShadow attack, RPC, and LDAP are used to: Register the machine account as a domain controller (using domain admin rights). Perform replication (using the granted replication rights) over DRSUAPI and send changes to directory objects. In this Defender for Identity detection, a security alert is triggered when a machine in the network tries to register as a rogue domain controller.",
