    "description": "Some Exchange vulnerabilities can be used in combination to allow unauthenticated remote code execution on devices running Exchange Server. Microsoft has also observed subsequent web shell implantation, code execution, and data exfiltration activities during attacks. This threat may be exacerbated by the fact that numerous organizations publish Exchange Server deployments to the internet to support mobile and work-from-home scenarios. In many of the observed attacks, one of the first steps attackers took following successful exploitation of CVE-2021-26855, which allows unauthenticated remote code execution, was to establish persistent access to the compromised environment via a web shell.",
