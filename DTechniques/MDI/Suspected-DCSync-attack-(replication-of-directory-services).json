    "description": "Active Directory replication is the process by which changes that are made on one domain controller are synchronized with all other domain controllers. Given necessary permissions, attackers can initiate a replication request, allowing them to retrieve the data stored in Active Directory, including password hashes. In this detection, an alert is triggered when a replication request is initiated from a computer that isn't a domain controller.",
