    "description": "Adversaries might exploit the Windows Print Spooler service to perform privileged file operations in an improper manner. An attacker who has (or obtains) the ability to execute code on the target, and who successfully exploits the vulnerability, could run arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on a target system. If run against a domain controller, the attack would allow a compromised non-administrator account to perform actions against a domain controller as SYSTEM. This functionally allows any attacker who enters the network to instantly elevate privileges to Domain Administrator, steal all domain credentials, and distribute further malware as a Domain Admin.",
