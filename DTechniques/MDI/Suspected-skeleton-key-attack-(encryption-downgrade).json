    "description": "Encryption downgrade is a method of weakening Kerberos using a downgraded encryption level for different fields of the protocol that normally have the highest level of encryption. A weakened encrypted field can be an easier target to offline brute force attempts. Various attack methods utilize weak Kerberos encryption cyphers. In this detection, Defender for Identity learns the Kerberos encryption types used by computers and users. The alert is issued when a weaker cypher is used that is unusual for the source computer, and/or user, and matches known attack techniques. Skeleton Key is malware that runs on domain controllers and allows authentication to the domain with any account without knowing its password. This malware often uses weaker encryption algorithms to hash the user's passwords on the domain controller. In this alert, the learned behavior of previous KRB_ERR message encryption from domain controller to the account requesting a ticket, was downgraded.",
