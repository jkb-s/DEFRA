    "description": "Attackers with domain admin rights can compromise the KRBTGT account. Using the KRBTGT account, they can create a Kerberos ticket granting ticket (TGT) that provides authorization to any resource and set the ticket expiration to any arbitrary time. This fake TGT is called a 'Golden Ticket' and allows attackers to achieve network persistence. This alert is triggered when a Kerberos ticket granting ticket is used for more than the allowed time permitted, as specified in the Maximum lifetime for user ticket.",
