    "description": "The Data Protection API (DPAPI) is used by Windows to securely protect passwords saved by browsers, encrypted files, and other sensitive data. Domain controllers hold a backup master key that can be used to decrypt all secrets encrypted with DPAPI on domain-joined Windows machines. Attackers can use the master key to decrypt any secrets protected by DPAPI on all domain-joined machines. In this detection, a Defender for Identity alert is triggered when the DPAPI is used to retrieve the backup master key.",
