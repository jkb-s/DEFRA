    "description": "Attackers with domain admin rights can compromise the KRBTGT account. Using the KRBTGT account, they can create a Kerberos ticket granting ticket (TGT) that provides authorization to any resource. This fake TGT is called a 'Golden Ticket' and allows attackers to achieve network persistence. In this detection, the alert is triggered by a golden ticket that was created by setting Resource Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD) permissions using the KRBTGT account for account (user\\computer) with SPN.",
