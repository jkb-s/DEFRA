    "description": "In a brute-force attack, the attacker attempts to authenticate with multiple passwords on different accounts until a correct password is found or by using one password in a large-scale password spray that works for at least one account. Once found, the attacker logs in using the authenticated account. In this detection, an alert is triggered when many authentication failures occur using Kerberos, NTLM, or use of a password spray is detected. Using Kerberos or NTLM, this type of attack is typically committed either horizontal, using a small set of passwords across many users, vertical with a large set of passwords on a few users, or any combination of the two.",
