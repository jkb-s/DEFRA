    "description": "An attacker can create a straightforward path to a Domain Admin user in an Active Directory environment that isn't patched. This escalation attack allows attackers to easily elevate their privilege to that of a Domain Admin once they compromise a regular user in the domain. When performing an authentication using Kerberos, Ticket-Granting-Ticket (TGT) and the Ticket-Granting-Service (TGS) are requested from the Key Distribution Center (KDC). If a TGS was requested for an account that couldn't be found, the KDC will attempt to search it again with a trailing $. When processing the TGS request, the KDC will fail its lookup for the requestor machine DC1 the attacker created. Therefore, the KDC will perform another lookup appending a trailing $. The lookup will succeed. As a result, the KDC will issue the ticket using the privileges of DC1$. Combining CVEs CVE-2021-42278 and CVE-2021-42287, an attacker with domain user credentials can leverage them for granting access as a domain admin.",
